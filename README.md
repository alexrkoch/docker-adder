# docker-adder

Simple command-line adder function to practice docker

## GOALS:

- Dockerize a program that takes 2 numbers via user CLI and returns the sum of
  those numbers.
- The program should be developed with tests using a simple CI/CD pipeline.

## NOTES:

- Maybe use the CI/CD pipeline described here: https://circleci.com/blog/build-cicd-piplines-using-docker/
